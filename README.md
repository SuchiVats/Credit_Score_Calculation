### Background: 
To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deep analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing basic customer details and extensive credit-related information. The aim is to create new, informative features, calculate a hypothetical credit score, and uncover meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights within the data.

### Objective: 
The project expects a deep dive into bank details and credit data, creating valuable features, a hypothetical credit score, and uncovering hidden patterns. This involves thorough EDA, strategic feature engineering, model-driven score calculation, and insightful analysis that reveals factors influencing creditworthiness and guides potential risk mitigation strategies.

### Methodology: 
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform a comprehensive EDA to understand the data’s structure, characteristics, distributions, and relationships. Identify and address any missing values, mismatch data types, inconsistencies, or outliers. Utilize appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation matrices) to uncover patterns and insights.

**Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can be leveraged for the calculation of credit scores based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA. Aggregate the data on the customer level if required Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation:

Develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score using relevant features(use a minimum of 5 maximum of 10 features). Clearly outline the developed methodology in the notebook, providing a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind it. (use inspiration from FICO scores and try to use relevant features you created) Explore various weighting schemes to assign scores. Provide a score for each individual customer.

### Outcomes: 
The system has achieve high accuracy in credit score classification, which will help financial institutions make more informed lending decisions. The system will also be scalable, meaning it can handle large volumes of credit score data without compromising its accuracy.

### Conclusion: 
Add valuable insights from EDA and credit score calculation Can credit score and aggregated features be calculated at different time frames like the last 3 months/last 6 months (recency based metrics)

Remember, your analysis isn’t just about dissecting data but uncovering actionable insights. Create a credit score strategy that you think would be the best and mention your justifications for criteria, weightage for the features. Suggestions are just general guidelines for the projects. It is not limited by that but serves as a starter and keeps it open to let you explore more, go into as much depth as you can, and actually make it your own project.
